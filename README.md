This application has been developed in the scope of my Bachelor's Thesis. In an era of information overload, search engines provide vast quantities of data, yet they often fail to deliver the results the user is most interested in. This thesis presents an iOS
application that bridges this gap by allowing users to scan objects in their environment and retrieve relevant, contextual information about them. 
The application leverages computer vision techniques, specifically object detection and segmentation using the YOLOv11s model, optimized for real-time performance on mobile devices.
